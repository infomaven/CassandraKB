USAGE
==========
usage: java org.apache.cassandra.tools.NodeCmd --host <arg> <command>


ex.
nodetool --host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx cfhistograms <keyspace> <cfname>



EXAMPLES
==========
- see Assessment, 20150505 Data model test, test.xls, nice-564 tab for visual examples of partitions with “hot spots”
- see Assessment, 20150505 Data model test, test.xls, nice-565 tab for visual examples of "two hump latency"



NOTES
===========
Hot spots:
hot spots can be monitored in JMX and with nodetool cfstats utility at the keyspace level



Read Latency: 
- If using Leveled compaction and SSDs, read latency should be < 5 us per SSTable 
seek. 
- Concurrency pipeline should have queue depth of 6. ((todo: find out where to see this
setting ))
- Histogram read latency should have majority of groups be 130 us or less. Double digits are not uncommon if using SSDs



Write Latency:

- If using Leveled compaction and SSDs, peak (longest latency) should be < 150 us. 
The C* write path writes to memory first, so this latency should stay constant regardless of the 
amount of data in storage. Higher values indicate problems with Data Model or Disk I/O 
problems - possibly underprovisioning
