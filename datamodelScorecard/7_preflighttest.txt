This test is good as a sanity check, but does not provide any results that are actionable
for the project team. 

Any issues found by this test would need to be forwarded to the DBA team, because they are
responsible for keeping the infrastructure working. They are also very conservative about
changing things at this time, because it appears they are about to enter a new 
development and test cycle. 


I would propose that we remove this test, but use the python scripts as models for 
automating some of our performance checks. 

What would be a good replacement for this item so we still have 10 points on which to 
base the report card?
